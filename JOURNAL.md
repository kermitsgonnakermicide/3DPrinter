# Day 1 - Research(June 14th)

I decided on making a CoreXY printer, as it is much faster and I believe its the best choice for speed and precision. I want this printer to be enclosed, so that I can print filaments other than PLA.<br>

I looked at a couple DIY corexys for inspiration, like this excellent low cost one<br>

Some important things I wanted to keep in mind though:<br>
I want to _try_ and use a rail driven system, as its more rigid than a belt driven system - however, the jury is still out on this one<br>
I defo want to leave budget for a BLTouch and a good quality printer enclosure<br>

**Time Spent - 1h30**

# Day 2 - Lock in(probably) June 30th

I hope i can finish this printer within the next few days - so without further ado, we shall begin
