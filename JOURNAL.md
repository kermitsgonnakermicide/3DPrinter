# CoreXY DIY Printer Build Log

**Total Time Spent So Far:** ~37 hours

---

## Day 1 – Research (June 14th)

After evaluating various printer designs, I decided to build a **CoreXY printer** because of its **high speed, accuracy, and reliability** compared to traditional bedslinger designs.  
An enclosed build was important to me as I want to print higher-temperature filaments like PETG, ABS, or Nylon with consistent results.

For inspiration, I explored several DIY CoreXY projects, especially this **excellent low-cost build**:

Key design considerations:
- Considering a **rail-driven system** instead of fully belt-driven for added rigidity (still undecided).
- Budget allocation for a **BLTouch** auto-bed-leveling sensor.
- Proper **printer enclosure** for material versatility and print quality.

**Time Spent:** 3h

## Day 2 – Frame Assembly (June 30th)

Started building the **frame using 2020 aluminum extrusion**, with a total cage size of **410x260 mm**. This forms the main structural base for the printer.

## Day 3 – Gantry Build (June 5th)

Returned to the project after a short break and made major progress:
- Added **corner brackets** to strengthen the frame.
- Increased printer height by **30 mm** for more build volume.
- Completed most of the **gantry assembly**, using **NEMA 17 motors**, **MGN12 linear rails**, and a **belt-driven motion system** for now.

## Day 4 – Z-Axis Assembly (June 10th)

Focused on the **Z-axis assembly** today and added some **quality-of-life improvements** like adjustable printer feet.

- Used **two stepper motors** for Z-axis movement.
- Planned to use a **220x220 mm heated bed** ([link](https://novo3d.in/3d-printer-heatbed-220x220mm/)).
- Built on **linear rails with belt-driven carriages** for smooth and stable vertical motion.

## Day 5 – Hotend & Extruder Setup (July 25th)

Worked on the **EVA 2.4-based hotend** assembly:
- Planning to use a **Bambu Labs hotend** for reliability and easy availability in India.
- Extruder will be an **LDO Orbiter** for high precision and lightweight direct drive.
