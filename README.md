# CoreXY DIY 3D Printer

This repository contains the design files, references, and build progress for a **custom CoreXY 3D printer**.  
The printer is designed for **speed, precision, and multi-material capability**, with a fully enclosed chamber to allow reliable printing of materials beyond PLA, such as PETG, ABS, and Nylon.

## Features

- **CoreXY Motion System:** High-speed, rigid frame for precise kinematics.
- **Fully Enclosed Build:** Helps maintain chamber temperature for advanced filaments.
- **Linear Rail Support:** Improved stability and reduced play compared to traditional V-slot rollers.
- **BLTouch Compatibility:** For automatic bed leveling and first-layer consistency.
- **Medium Build Volume:** Approximately **220 x 220 mm bed size** with a compact frame footprint.
- **Modular Design:** Allows upgrades to the toolhead, extruder, or motion components over time.

## Goals

- Build a **high-speed, reliable CoreXY printer**.
- Maintain **rigidity and precision** through linear rails and a solid frame.
- Support **high-temperature filaments** with an enclosed chamber.
- Leave room for future **modular upgrades** (e.g., tool changers, multi-material system).
